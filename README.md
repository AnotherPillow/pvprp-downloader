# PVPRP Downloader

A command-line tool to download PVPRP packs without being redirected to various viruses.

## Usage

1. Download the source.
2. Install the dependencies via `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script via `py main.py`.
4. Enter the URLs(or drag them from the website to terminal) of the packs you want to download.
5. Enter `y` (default) to download the packs, or `n` to just get the URLs.
6. You're done! The packs will be in your downloads folder if on Windows, or in a folder called `output` in the script directory.

## Why?

I got redirected when clicking on the main download button. That's it.
