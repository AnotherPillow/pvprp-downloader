# PVPRP Downloader

A command-line tool to download PVPRP packs without being redirected to various viruses.

## Usage

1. Download the source.
2. Install the dependencies via `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script via `py main.py`.
4. Enter the URL of the pack you want to download.
5. Enter `y` or to download the pack, or `n` to just get the URL.
6. You're done! The pack will be in your downloads folder if on Windows, or in the same directory as the script if not.

## Why?

I got redirected when clicking on the main download button. That's it.
